# Trig-Visualization

# About
 This program was written using the simple Python GUI module, pygame. It also utilizes the math module from the Python standard library.
# Purpose
Simple program that is designed to show how the trigonometric functions sin and cos are related to the unit circle. The yellow circle on the x-axis corresponds to cos(theta), the yellow circle on the y-axis corresponds to sin(theta), and the line between them creates the angle theta. The red ball is always at the x coordinate of the horizontal yellow ball and the y coordinate of the vertically moving yellow ball.
